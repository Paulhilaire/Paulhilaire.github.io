## Experience

### Postdoctoral position in Quantum Optics and Quantum Information theory:

#### Leiden University, Leiden (Netherlands)
Apr. 2021 - today  
Advisors: W. Löffler, E. Barnes, S. Economou.

#### Virginia Tech, Blacksburg Virginia (USA))
Jul. 2019 - Apr. 2021  
Advisors: S. Economou, E. Barnes.

##### Projects:
Spin quantum control in solid-state defects including self-assembled quantum dots and colored center in diamonds (NV centers, SiV centers, ...). I’ve developed an all-optical leakage cancellation technique for high fidelity single qubit gates in Lambda-system (such as quantum dots).

- Photonic cluster state generation with solid-state quantum emitters.  
- Graph state applications for quantum communication and quantum computation. I’ve demonstrated the viability of all-photonic quantum repeater generated from a few matter qubits.  
- Qluster collaborations (Fet-Open Horizon 2020 european project):
Hebrew University at Jerusalem, with Hagai Eisenberg, C2N Paris, with Pascale Senellart: Implementation of an hybrid scheme for photonic graph state generation using deterministic graph state generation and linear optics for NISQ devices.   
- University of Cambridge, with Mete Atature and Claire Le Gall: Applications of long-lived memories in quantum dots based on single magnon excitation.

##### General collaborations:

- University of Pittsburg, with Gurudev Dutt: Implementation of dynamically corrected gates for high fidelity NV-center spin control.  
- JILA, University of Colorado Boulder, with Shuo Sun: Performance analysis of quantum repeater protocols.  
- Keio university, with Rodney Van Meter: Simulation of quantum repeater protocols using a quantum network simulator.  
- LIP6, Sorbonne University, with Fréderic Grosshans: Application of graph state for quantum communication protocols. (Currently visiting LIP6 for a year)

### PhD in Quantum Nanophotonics:
(Nov. 2015 - Jun. 2019)   
Center for Nanosciences and Nanotechnology (C2N-CNRS, Palaiseau, France)/ University of Paris, Paris (France))   
Project: *"A cavity-based spin-photon interface"*,  
Supervisor: L. Lanco.

##### Experimental physics:  
- Implemented the first polarization tomography experiment to characterize the polarization qubit after interaction with a single quantum dot.  
- Demonstrated 96% input coupling with a light-matter interface, measured with unprecedented 1% accuracy through polarization tomography.
Proposed and implemented a process to fully deterministically build a solid-state spin-photon platform useful for quantum information protocols.  
- Performed a single spin noise spectroscopy at the single photon level.

##### Simulations:  
- Programmed a platform to simulate the optical response of cavity-QED devices with quantum dot transitions (polarization tomography, 2nd order correlations, magnetic field, ...).  
- Studied the optical signature of different noise mechanisms for neutral and charged quantum dot using both master equation and semi-classical approaches.


##### Teaching experience:
- Supervised the trainings of 3 undergraduate students and the first year of a junior PhD student (during my PhD) and two PhD students (postdoc).
- Teacher in lab and tutorial courses to undergraduate classes at University Paris-Diderot (Paris).
